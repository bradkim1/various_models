It incudes the following.

1.Data Preprocessing - Cleaning, feature selection, transformations.

2.Automated Model Experimentation - Testing multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

3.Hyperparameter Tuning - Using Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.

4.Model Evaluation - Selecting the best performance metric (accuracy, F1, RMSE).

5.Ensemble Learning - Combining multiple models for improved results.

6.Cross-validation & Overfitting Analysis - Ensuring model generalization.

7.Results & Visualization - Analyzing performance with visualizations.

8.Best Model Deployment - Saving and exporting the model.
